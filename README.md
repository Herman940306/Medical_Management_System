# Medical_Management_System
Develop a web-based Medical Management System that includes user authentication and CRUD operations for users, patients, and visits. The system will provide a secure login screen that authenticates users from the users table. The project will be implemented using Python for the backend, Django for the frontend, and SQLite for the database.
